## üìå Additional
### Classification of versions
The version of the modpack is defined relative 
to the version of Minecraft on which this build will run.
This is done to make it easier to pick up 
and determine the version of the modpack for your version of the game.

The version scheme can be represented in `X.Y.Z`, 
where `X` is the number of Minecraft minor releases, 
and `Y` is the number of version patches. 
`Z`, on the other hand, is used as the patches for the build itself.

The `X` countdown starts with Minecraft version 1.17. 
At the moment the build is running on Minecraft 1.18.2 and has version 2.2.5
