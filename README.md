‚ú® This is a modpack that will make your game much more enjoyable and comfortable than you are used to.

ü™Ñ This modpack gives you great performance on different configurations of personal computers, while allowing you to keep all the things you are so used to: *CTM*, *CIT*, *Capes*, *CEM*, *Zoom* and etc from **Optifine**.

üéÄ We strive to make your Minecraft game **more immersive** by keeping and adhering to the ideas of the game itself without changing the internal mechanics and systems. 
Try to make the modpack accessible to everyone by **optimizing** game systems with well-known and popular modifications.

üéâ And all this is already available and ready to play, you only need to install modpack and enjoy your gameplay!

Thank you üíñ for being there and have a nice game!

### To improve performance, try custom JVM arguments:
Set minimum memory allocation equal to maximum memory allocation:
```
-XX:+UseG1GC -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M
```
or for >8GB RAM:
```
-XX:+UseShenandoahGC -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -Dfml.ignorePatchDiscrepancies=true -Dfml.ignoreInvalidMinecraftCertificates=true -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat -Dfml.readTimeout=180
```
4GB RAM is recommended for 12 chunks, more requires more memory!

### Classification of versions
The version of the modpack is defined relative 
to the version of Minecraft on which this build will run.
This is done to make it easier to pick up 
and determine the version of the modpack for your version of the game.

The version scheme can be represented in `X.Y.Z`, 
where `X` is the number of Minecraft minor releases, 
and `Y` is the number of version patches. 
`Z`, on the other hand, is used as the patches for the build itself.

The `X` countdown starts with Minecraft version 1.17. 
At the moment the build is running on Minecraft 1.18.2 and has version 2.2.5
